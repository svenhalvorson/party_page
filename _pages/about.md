You're probably looking for [my resume](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/resume.html) or a [writing sample](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/sample_hemo.html).

My path to being interested in data, statistics, and programming was pretty haphazard. I studied math because I couldn't get an A in any other subject, dropped the only programming class I signed up for in college, and didn't like statistics until after completing my MS. Now I get paid to write R programs and conduct statistical analyses full time. I'm extremely lucky to have landed into a field that is engaging and difficult. My favorite aspects are data visualization, exploring databases, and making the computer do my bidding.

I'm most interested in using my skill set for: 
+ Non-profit work
+ Social sciences
+ Biostatistics
+ Creating educational materials
+ Creative expression

I'm also interested in becoming skilled in Mexican cuisine. Hit me up with your recipes.
