You're probably looking for (my resume)[https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/resume.html].

My path to being interested in data, statistics, and programming was pretty haphazard. I studied math because I couldn't get an A in any other subject, dropped the only programming class I signed up for in college, and didn't like statistics until after completing my MS. Now I get paid to write R programs and conduct statistical analyses full time. My favorite aspects are data visualization, exploring databases, and making the computer do my bidding.

I'm most interested in using my skill set for: 
+ Non-profit work
+ Social sciences
+ Biostatistics
+ Creating educational materials
+ Creative expression

My near term goals are to become a proficient python programmer, expand my SQL skills, and review many of the modeling techniques from my graduate education.

I'm also interested in becoming skilled in Mexican cooking. Hit me up with your recipes.
