Welcome to my little slice of the internet.

As a former teacher, I find the challenge of explaining something almost as much fun as learning it in the first place. The content on this page was created in part to solidify my learning as well to share with others. I hope you enjoy my whimsical blurbs on programming and statistics.

In no particular order, here are some of my larger personal projects:

{% include gallery id='gallery1' caption="" layout = "third" %}

And some 'blog post' style musings:
* [Confusion matrices reminder](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/confusion_matrix)
* [Tidyverse style: I am a very persnickety person](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/tidyverse_indentation)
* [The cutest little virus](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/cutest_little_virus)
* [Harvard's STAT110](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/stat110)
* [K-means replication](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/k_means)
