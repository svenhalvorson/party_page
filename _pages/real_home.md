Welcome to my little slice of the internet.

The purpose of this page is to store and display some vaguely career related projects. I'm doing this in part to demonstrate my abilities but mostly because I just enjoy learning and programming!

Here are some of my larger 'for fun' projects:

{% include gallery id='gallery1' caption="" layout = "third" %}

Some small stuff:
* [Tidyverse style: I am a very persnickety person](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/tidyverse_indentation)
* [The cutest little virus](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/cutest_little_virus)
* [Harvard's STAT110](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/stat110)
* [K-means replication](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/k_means)
