Welcome to my little slice of the internet.

I would like to think of myself as a lifelong learner and I've found that creating materials is essential in that goal. It's important that I create public reminders of the rabbit holes I've gone down. This is both so that I can recall the specific subject matter but also so that I don't lose sight of the progress I'm making. I hope you enjoy my whimsical blurbs on programming and statistics.

In no particular order, here are some of my larger projects:

{% include gallery id='gallery1' caption="" layout = "third" %}

And some 'blog post' type musings:
* [Tidyverse style: I am a very persnickety person](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/tidyverse_indentation)
* [The cutest little virus](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/cutest_little_virus)
* [Harvard's STAT110](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/stat110)
* [K-means replication](https://svenhalvorson.github.io/party_page/portfolio/k_means)
